---👋 Hi, I’m @Madhan-D249  
-  💼 I’m interested in automating all the things — including my coffee machine (still working on it).  
-  🌱 I’m currently learning Kubernetes, GitHub Actions, and how not to break prod.  
-  🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure as code, and quirky automation scripts.  
-  📫 How to reach me: Ping me on GitHub or send a message via carrier API.  
-  � Pronouns: Dev/Ops  
-  ⚡ Fun fact: I once automated a deployment and accidentally deployed to my toaster. It didn’t scale well.
